- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nic-gitlab

- I recently completed a full stack software development bootcamp, and am currently working on projects in SwiftUI for iOS mobile development.

During the bootcamp I completed projects where I worked with elements of the following languages and frameworks:

- Javascript, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Node.js, Express.
- Java, Hibernate, JSP, Spring, Spring.
- databases using PostgreSQL, and React front end.

Some of the main concepts covered were test driven development, object oriented programing, web design, coding best practices, project development including user stories, and front end/ back end data validation.
